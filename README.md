# Python_Sign_Language_Detection


ðŸ¤Ÿ Sign Detection using Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn
This project implements a real-time hand sign recognition system using a webcam feed. It leverages Mediapipe for hand landmark detection and scikit-learn (with a trained Random Forest Classifier) for gesture classification.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV â€“ for video capture and display

Mediapipe â€“ for hand landmark detection

scikit-learn â€“ for model training and prediction

NumPy â€“ for numerical operations

SciPy â€“ for preprocessing or support functions

Pickle â€“ to load the trained model

ðŸ“¦ Features
Detects hand landmarks in real-time from webcam input

Classifies custom hand signs (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'L')

Draws bounding boxes and labels on the detected hand

Lightweight and runs on CPU with TensorFlow Lite backend

ðŸš€ How It Works
Capture video feed using OpenCV.

Detect hand landmarks using Mediapipe.

Extract features by normalizing landmark positions.

Predict the gesture using a pre-trained RandomForestClassifier.

Display the predicted gesture on the video frame.
